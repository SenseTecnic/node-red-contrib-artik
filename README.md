This is a simple node module that performs the following tasks on Artik board:
1) Switch a GPIO pin on or off
2) Read the digital value of a GPIO pin 

NOTE: due to the different hardware configuration on different versions of the Artik board, users should look up the pin value from the Artik pin mapping.
