This is a simple node module that performs the following tasks on Artik board:
1) Setup an OUT GPIO pin
2) Setup an IN GPIO pin, able to read interrupt
3) Setup an ADC GPIO pin, able to read between 0~1.8V
4) Setup and PWM GPIO pin


NOTE: due to the different hardware configuration on different versions of the Artik board, users should look up the physical pin value from the Artik pin mapping.
